Lattice Checkers Rules.
The playing field is a diagonal spatial lattice.
The goal of the game is to move as many of your pieces (balls) as possible to the opposite (opponent's) side of this lattice (from the bottom -> up).
As in ordinary checkers, during a move the player must move one of his balls forward (to opponent's direction) at one of the free neighboring nodes or "take" the opponent's ball in a neighboring node (in any direction - up and down), if next node behind the opponent's ball in the same direction is free. Making "take " ball shall been moved to this free node , the opponent's ball shall been removed out. If the ball who can be taken exists you must take it.
Player can "take" several opponent's balls in one move by the same way.
But there are also differences from ordinary checkers.
If your ball have reached the opposite level of the grid (the opponent's initial level), the ball will turn into a "star" and you can return one of your balls previously taken by your opponent (if any), and place this ball on any free node of your initial level (if there are free nodes). "Stars" can move like ordinary balls, after they have taken the opponent's ball that ended up behind (lower).
The game ends when one of the players loses all balls and stars or if the opponents have no moves.
The winner is the one with more of their pieces reaching the opposite level.
While playing with the computer, you can choose one of three levels of artificial intelligence, the dimension of the lattice, the colors of the balls and who will make the first move. You can rewind the game back and continue from any move, save the current game and load it later.
